Internet censorship is basically the restriction of what can be viewed, published, and accessed online. There are three agents of power when it comes to internet censorship: governments, companies, and individuals. The methods of internet censorship vary as much as their reasons. Internet censorship has always been a pretty controversial topic for years now as the internet has become a wellspring for information and communication and censorship is a way of shutting off countries and movements to the world.  The global nature and the reach of the Internet pose difficulties in controlling content that have never come up with other mediums for communicating and disseminating information. Some countries already censor parts of the Internet, blocking websites and shutting down social media services like Twitter in times of unrest. We sometimes feel uncomfortable around a word like “censor”; it sounds too much like our freedoms are being denied. However, the Internet can be censored in such a way that it remains a good source of information and a lively social space while protecting those who are most vulnerable to Internet exploitation. </p>

Pornography is a big business on the Internet. This is perfectly legal in many places, and plenty of people would say that consenting adults should be able to do as they like as long as they aren’t hurting anyone. Those last four words are key; porn has always been an exploitative industry, and the Internet has only made it worse. At one level there is the exploitation of adults, men and women, who may have been coerced into appearing in porn clips for any number of reasons. This problem isn’t unique to the Internet, but some other problems are. One of these is the proliferation of amateur porn. Too often, clips of people are uploaded without their knowledge or consent. The two worst problems concern sex trafficking and child pornography. It’s one thing if someone is coerced into porn because they need the money or have a drug problem; sex trafficking, however, crosses the coercion line into abuse, rape and kidnapping, and victims may be forced to perform in pornography. Child pornography is a particularly big problem on the Internet, and unfortunately pedophiles are now literally able to network in a way they never have in the past. While both sex trafficking and child pornography are already illegal, the Internet provides a whole new world of profit and distribution for those behind these crimes. Do the rights of people to freely surf the Internet trump the rights and protections due to children and victims of sex trafficking? </p>

	Furthermore, it is hard to supervise children all the time. For this reason, there should be a way of censoring content which is available on the Internet. Moreover, Internet ought not to be a place where kids can have an easy entrant to sexually elucidated material. Therefore, the internet ought to also have a way of ensuring decency on content which is not suitable for children.
On the other hand, Internet censorship seems to discourage entrepreneurship; for example, it is hard to approximate the number of entrepreneurs in china who need to access websites and information which is obstructed by the Great Firewall. This inefficiency is costly to countries particularly in the region of home-grown innovation.  Absence of innovation derives partly from entrepreneur’s lack of knowledge concerning newest trends, something which is brought about by the blocked censored nature of some websites. Therefore, one can clearly see that currently, there is an imbalance in Internet censorship because the authorities seem to overlook some factors when undertaking the censorship. </p>
<p>

if voluntarily done, some form of censorship can work especially to protect young children and the sensitive-at-heart. Particularly censoring and placing filters on your computer blocking access to pornographic websites, phishing, websites which allow for torrenting and bootlegging media, and YouTube videos which may contain explicit content at hand. More or less, it depends on how you and your family approach the content. AOL UK done a little neat PIF (public information film) about the darker underbelly of logging on the Internet showcasing porn, black market sales, neo-Nazi propaganda, surveillance and usage of cookies to track what you want to buy or sites you browse plentifully, etc. </p>

Every year, pirates get more and more clever about skirting national and international laws and distributing intellectual content illegally. People may think of piracy as something that only hurts big companies like movie studios, but individuals are hurt by it as well. If no one wants to pay for musicians’ music, how do musicians support themselves so they can make more music? Many on the other side of this issue claim that information should be free, but they forget that real people are taking time out of their lives to create that information. Writers, for example, have the same 24 hours in a day as anyone else, and writing a book takes time; if writers can’t make any money in the seven hours a day they are working on the novel, they will have to shift their time management and use those seven hours to make money in some other way. Furthermore, the work creative people do belongs to them in the same way any other possession belongs to a person. Again, the right of people to have a free and open Internet does not take precedence over the right of creators to own and distribute their creations. </p>
<p>


Censoring is a word that frightens many people, but if applied in a thoughtful, measured way that is in accordance with community standards, censoring the Internet can protect vulnerable populations including children from sexual exploitation, reduce hate crimes and terrorism and better protect intellectual property. Internet “freedom” is an abstract concept, but these are real people damaged by real problems that are the result of an uncensored Internet. Censoring the Internet will make both the Internet and the world a better place.
