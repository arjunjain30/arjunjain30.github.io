    <p>Farmers committing suicide can be a truly embarrassing situation for any society. The issues compelling the farmers to commit suicide are required to be paid attention immediately, as the farmers toil tirelessly to produce grain for us without which we can’t survive. In recent times the statistics have depicted an alarming rate of the incidents of farmers committing suicide in India which has become a matter of grave concern. If we fail to give timely attention to this growing issue, the situation may get even worse and the nation will have to pay very grave socio-economic costs.<br>
These days the peasants and the small scale farmers have to invest a lot more when compared to large scale farming in proportion to the yield. Consequently for the peasants agriculture is turning out to be an expensive affair and the benefit of inadequate land ceilings favours the big landlords, who are influential in the commercial markets. Over the last 2 decades around 300,000 farmers have tragically ended their lives by ingesting pesticides or by hanging themselves. Most of those farmers owned their small patch of land. Even the land reforms in Kerala, West Bengal and the very limited land reforms in other parts of the country actually demonstrated the limitations of just the mere distribution of land to the impoverished layer of the masses. Quite obviously the key is an immediate support to those farmers in poverty like facilities to procure agricultural utilities, free electricity to the impoverished rural population, thorough irrigation, crop security/ insurance and welfare schemes. </p><p>

The farmers are just another name for austerity and hard work. Ours is an agricultural based country where almost 70 per cent of the population still depends on agriculture. That is why you can find green farms spread over all across the country. In any weather, be it sweltering sun or freezing winters, the farmers in this country can be seen working in their fields round-the-clock. The entire life of the farmers is spent in cultivating their fields. Without any complain they remain engaged in their work. Farming is not at all an easy task, as it includes working in the fields round-the-clock, crop cultivation and planting, besides crop care, harvesting the crops and then selling the produced crops in the market.
<br>

With globalisation and the growing influence of neoliberal policies in all avenues including agriculture the lives of even small land holding peasants is starkly exposed to the fluctuating national and international market forces. Consequentially an epidemic of farmers’ suicides by hundreds of thousands of peasants left with no other choice but to surrender their lives and their small patch of land after a life of hard work and toil. Lost lives and alienated land! Those who managed to survive these nightmarish conditions will still be haunted by poverty wages, unemployment or sometimes even uprooted from their land and communities to urban areas where often their fates are no different. Also with the recent protests against the question of caste and the oppression of women it is still many times severe and deeply ingrained in the rustic areas and those brutalities often don’t find the vents that the urban centres, universities and the metropolitan centric media sometimes allow. </p><p>
So we find farmers bribing FCI officials in order to sell their grains to FCI. On a MSP of Rs. 1000 per tonne, they pay sometimes Rs. 100-200 per tonne to FCI officials to get their grain bought by FCI. And in many cases, the cultivation cost can be as high as Rs. 800-900 per tonne, turning their venture into a loss. This does not happen so much in Haryana or Punjab, but if you were to read about Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh or other places, you may find this, it used to be news on a daily basis when I was a student.<br>

Clearly it is an imperative for any organisations which identifies itself with the struggle of the oppressed to make no compromises whatsoever in this serious issue of eradicating the backwardness and the appalling impoverishment flowing from this persisting landlordism. It is not only the landlordists and pro-capitalist regimes but both the Communist parties, who instead of campaigning for an independent and decisive leadership of the growing working class forces in India along with the agrarian workers and peasants are now openly resorting to the politics of opportunism – blatantly showcasing the decay, and the bankruptcy of Stalinism. </p><p>
So probably considering all this, they may well think, well, we can't pay back the debt, we are already humiliated by money lenders and banks, and the government is not going to do anything. Worse, even if someone in the government cares about us, others will ensure nothing happens. Probably the government doesn't even understand the farmers. And with increasing cultivation costs and decreasing profits and increasing debts, with no knowledge of any law which can save them (and even lack of institutions I guess), combined with the idea that a suicide may get their family some cash which can reduce the debt on the family, they probably give up their life.<br>
It is only through the determined struggle of working class forces along with all the oppressed layers of the society that the problems of this backwardness will be genuinely resolved. It is important to radically solve the land question and simultaneously nationalise the commanding heights of economy, with planned production and distribution under democratic workers’ control; aiming to fulfil the agrarian requirements to improve and enhance lives. Obviously in a vast land mass like India there is no one fixed solution and the practical complexities of the land redistribution program have to be resolved with the participation of the independent peasant committees’ and agricultural workers associations. Democratically run farmers’ cooperatives and large scale voluntary collective farming should be encouraged. Measures should be undertaken to seriously address the existing inequalities in land ownership among women, Dalits and other oppressed layers. Necessary social and legal measures should be taken to uplift the lives of those oppressed sections of the society, in particular Dalits and women. Every possible means should be diverted towards the provisioning of education, healthcare and decent employment for all to weed out the backwardness that is strangling this society at present.” </p><p>
The government can implement a range of welfare schemes for the farmers, besides agricultural development plans to prevent the farmers from committing suicides. Moreover, it can also implement crop insurance schemes for the farmers, besides helping them by offering farming loans on minimal interest rates through cooperative banks. It can also provide them high-quality seeds, fertilizers and other agricultural equipments on minimal cost. Moreover, the government can also provide land to the landless farmers. Through these measures it can easily prevent the situations which compel the farmers to commit suicide.<br>
The issue of farmers committing suicide has now become a national problem. If this situation is not controlled early, it will get out of the hand. For the farmers it is urgently required to offer them high support prices as well as crop insurance. High support price for their crops is also required besides making available easy credit for themselves. These are the only ways through which the situation of farmers can be improved and they may be prevented from committing suicide. </p>
