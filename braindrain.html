 Brain Drain refers to the immigration of scientists, engineers, doctors and other technically qualified persons usually from an underdeveloped and undeveloped country to a more advanced or developed country.<br>
Every year thousands of skilled professionals and Indians trained abroad make frantic efforts to leave India and stay abroad.
Brain drain is when highly qualified and educated people,who have been educated in one country either go to another country or are attracted to another country to work and use their expertise in that country. <br>

For example:
An IIT graduate from India, goes abroad to work in Google the moment he passes out.

He received subsidised high quality education in India, but uses his skills for a corporation abroad to add to their revenues.</p>

<p>Brain Drain refers to the immigration of scientists, engineers, doctors and other technically qualified persons usually from an underdeveloped and undeveloped country to a more advanced or developed country.

Brain drain is one of the biggest problems India is facing to be a developed country. How can a country develop when the best minds from that country tend to move to other countries? My friend, this is the 21st21st century, the era of globalization. We are all free to go and live in any country we want, that is our legal right. </p>
<p>


Causes of Brain Drain: There are some sad facts behind the great brain drain in India.
One of the main reasons is the widespread unemployment and underemployment in our country. The excess of skilled professionals in India has bred an army of educated unemployed. Rather than return home to unemployment, skilled Indians prefer to stay back in the West, where professionals command at better market value.
The problem is with the policies and mindset of India. Allow me to explain. Driving in India is such a difficult thing, because you have to keep an eye for the traffic approaching you from front, on a one way road. You have to keep an eye to your left and right before crossing a road that is regulated by traffic lights. You can’t keep a decent gap between your car and that in front of you, as 4–5 two wheeler vehicles will fill that gap. Wow!

While certain first world counties such as UK have also experienced major brain drain, the phenomenon is more common in developing countries such as India and China. There are many factors that are responsible for brain drain in these countries. Higher salaries, better medical facilities, access to advanced technology, better standard of living and more stable political conditions are among few of the things that attract professionals towards the developed countries. </p>
<p>


Conclusion
Several countries across the globe are facing the problem of brain drain and the government of these countries are taking certain measures to control the same however the problem still persists. Better plans need to be put in to place to control this issue.

The lack of research facilities in India is also one of the causes for Brain Drain from India. Scientists and other research professionals need sophisticated equipment to carry on their research related works.
The better job conditions and higher standard of living in those countries lure these qualified professionals to decide to stay on there. </p>
