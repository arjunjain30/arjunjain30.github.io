        The proverb,<b> “The pen is mightier than the sword” </b>implies that the power of pen is enormous, even more than a sword. A small pen can help you achieve what a mighty sword cannot. The power of a pen is emphasized by way of this proverb. It implies that a pen is capable of achieving that what even a big sword cannot.<br></p>
        <p>
The famous proverb ‘Pen is Mightier than the Sword’ has a great significance since ages. It denotes that the pen is more powerful than the sword; irrespective of the fact that the sword has a sharp edge and the power to kill and win wars. From the ancient days, sword has played an important role in the history of mankind. We all know that the sword has the power of winning wars because of the great strength and valour it possesses. But a pen on the other hand, despite being delicate is much mightier and endowed with the capacity to transform history and mankind.

Written by the famous author Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the proverb ‘The Pen is Mightier than the Sword’ holds great significance with simple yet profound meaning. It suggests that the writers of the world leave a greater influence on people than the soldiers; for the world recognises the name of several famous writers such as William Wordsworth, John Keats, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Rabindranath Tagore, etc but very few will be able to recognise the names of great soldiers who won wars, battles, etc. For ages, pen has been creating wonders as written information gets spread as knowledge which is preserved with people for their lifetime. The proverb clearly indicates that the writers are more influential than the mighty fighters and the sword cannot build such impact which writers can. </p>
<p>

Writing can unite people to stand against social or national evil. Mahatma Gandhi through his preaching and knowledge united the citizens; he didn’t fight but won the nation with his power of wisdom and will. A war may result into victory to one party and defeat to the other at the cost of several lives; but a book can enlighten the world without harming even a single person, without any bloodshed. </p><p>


Pen is the weapon of writers, which they can use to create history. Pen is constructive, while sword is destructive. A pen has the capacity to write novels, poems, humorous, emotional stories, facts and figures related to Science, Maths, Geography, etc. One can find joy and peace by reading and gain knowledge for lifetime. Writings can induce various emotions such as love, kindness, hatred, enmity, sympathy etc. Writing is regarded with respect and writers are always considered as the strong pillars of society as they have the power to change the world through the magic of their writing. Even on national level, debates and discussions can solve various altercations amongst differing countries, but war can destroy the economical and physical strength of the countries. On personal level too, literature spreads knowledge but fighting induces hatred. </p>
<p>

In the world of political war and unrest; we need more pens than swords. The fact is that men are more influenced and guided by ideas than by the fear of sword or physical forces. It is true, that the command of the sword is restrained to a particular time period but the influence of pen is immortal and universal. The writer must use this power with utmost care, for their writing can either make or break the image of huge personalities, because pen is mightier than sword.
