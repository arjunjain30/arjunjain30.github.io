        <p><b>BETI BACHAO BETI PADHAO </b>is the token scheme to aware people about the importance of girls in the society, to increase awareness among common people, to celebrate the birth of girl child, to save the lives of girl child by completely removing the female foeticide. Haryana was the obvious choice to launch the campaign which features the lowest sex ratio in India with just 877 women per 1000 males. These campaigns/schemes would remain partially successful until and unless we make strict laws to give severe punishment to culprits.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Prime Minister Narendra Modi </u>has launched a scheme for girls named Beti Bachao Beti Padhao in order to save the girl child and educate the girl child all over the India. The programme was launched on 22nd of January, Thursday in 2015 at Panipat,. This scheme was launched especially in Haryana as this state has lowest female sex ratio (775 girls/1000 boys) all over the country. It has been effectively implemented in hundred districts across the country to improve the status of girls. 12 districts (Ambala, Kurukshetra, Rewari, Bhiwani, Mahendergarh, Sonepat, Jhajjar, Rohtak, Kaithal, Panipat, Karnal, and Yamuna Nagar) have been chosen from the Haryana state itself because of having low child sex ratio. </p><p>
        <b>Child Sex Ratio (CSR)</b> is defined as number of girls per 1000 of boys between 0-6 years of age.<br>
India has seen a trend of decline in the CSR for a long time now.<br>
•	In 1961 it was 961.<br>
•	In 1991 it became 945.<br>
•	In 2001 it got reduced to 927.<br>
•	By 2011 it reached a new low of 918.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Various governments have tried to address this issue, but as per the trend, it is evident that they all have failed. After coming to power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government has initiated a scheme in the name of “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao”(BBBP). The Overall Goal of the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Scheme is to Celebrate the Girl Child & Enable her Education.<br>
   Government has understood that the survival, protection and empowerment of the girl children of this nation is only possible with coordinated and convergent efforts its multiple wings. To achieve this a national campaign is devised. In this initiative, a focussed multi sectoral action will be taken up by government, initially in 100 gender critical districts (with low CSR) in the country. This initiative will cover all States and UTs. Currently it is run as a joint initiative of Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development.<br></p>
        <p>
Two main components are identified for this campaign :<br>
1.	Mass Communication Campaign on Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.<br>
2.	Multi-Sectoral interventions in 100 Gender Critical Districts covering all States/UTs .<br></p><p>
        <b>Main objectives of this campaign are :</b><br>
1.	Prevention of gender biased sex selective elimination.<br>
2.	Ensuring survival & protection of the girl child.<br>
3.	Ensuring education and participation of the girl child.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
Some positive steps have been taken in the last few years for betterment of woman and girl child, passes of Maternity Benefit Bill with better terms, Commercial Surrogacy Bill, Child labour Bill. Online search engines have asked not publish sex determination ads. Direct money transfer (DBT) to help (Pregnant) woman/Girl child from deprived background. Money transfer and other social benefits are given in the hand of leading lady of the house and a lot of initiatives are taken by the new government. </p>
