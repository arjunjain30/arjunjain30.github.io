        <b> “Necessity is the mother of invention”, a well known proverb, implies that when you are left with no other option but to complete a certain task or live through a certain situation you manage to do so by any means. </b></p>
<p>

The proverb, “necessity is the mother of invention” is used commonly as what it states holds true in real life. It implies that when it is really necessary to accomplish a task you actually end up doing it by hook or crook. Here are some Necessity is the Mother of Invention essays of varying lengths to give you further insight into the proverb and help you with the topic in your classroom, exam, etc. <br>
‘Necessity is the mother of Invention’ is a world famous proverb which a child also knows about. The quotation is not technical; instead it’s very simple and uncomplicated to explain its meaning with certain interpretations which makes the proverb highly impactful. </p>
<p>

The proverb ‘Necessity is the mother of invention’ implies that when we are in a dire need of  something and if we cannot be happy or survive without that particular thing, then we find means and ways to satisfy that need which may result into something called invention. If someone is hungry; then in order to satisfy the hunger, food is cooked. So hunger is the necessity and food is the invention. There are several other examples which explain the meaning of this famous proverb. In fact, most of the popular and beneficial things of the world are the result of necessity that made the inventors restless and compelled them to invent the product. Some of such greatest inventions are bulb, radio, television, motor, mobile, aeroplane and many more. </p>
<p>

Invention and necessity are co-related and until wants become necessities a person won’t get into action. Anything and everything that we use in our day to day life is the result of need or necessity and human’s desire to fulfil that need. This signifies that even luxury items such as air conditioners, cars, etc have been invented to satisfy specific needs. </p>
<p>

Necessity also makes us hard working and ingenuous. If we look at history, especially the primitive age when there was nothing for the mankind to survive; people invented clothes, food, shelter and thus the civilisation started. </p>
<p>

Some inventions make our life not only comfortable but also worth living such as electricity. Imagine a life without light; thanks to Thomas Edison, whose desire to remove darkness from his surrounding gave us light and benefitted the entire world. </p>
<p>

But some inventions are destructive such guns, bombs, weapons, etc. Even though, these weapons have also been invented out of the necessity for self protection or for protecting the nation; but these are dangerous and there is always a fear to get harmed in some or other ways. It is important that self need doesn’t become the reason of other’s destruction. </p>
<p>

Necessity and Inventions are positively inter-related as necessity forces or drives people to action. Human beings, in order to survive need money, which compels them to find a job which will give them salary in the form of money and the money can be further utilised to satisfy all types of need for food, clothing, shelter, etc. </p>
<p>

Not only does necessity compels people to invent means of survival but it also drives people to work smarter in order to get promotion and better position in their profession. A desire or will to achieve success in professional life inspire people to do better than others and thus they invent new means and methods to win the competition. </p>
<p>

Necessity must be seen as an opportunity to do better and achieve success in life and no destructive inventions should be undertaken to harm others. The proverb has been taught to people since their childhood in positive aspect and the meaning of the proverb must remain so and not in the negative manner.
