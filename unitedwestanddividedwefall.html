 “United we stand, divided we fall” is commonly used at different places to emphasize as to how important it is to stay united. The importance of team work has been stressed upon here. “United we stand, divided we fall” is a phrase used to inspire unity and team work. As per this phrase if members of a group work on their own to serve their own individual interests rather than working as a team then they are likely to be doomed and defeated.<br>
The phrase was coined during the ancient era by the Greek storyteller Aesop. It had a direct mention in his fable “The Four Oxen and the Lion” and indirect one in “The Bundle of Sticks”.<br>
The New Testament also includes a similar phrase that reads, “And if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand”. Other phrases from the New Testament read, “And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand” and “But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth”. </p>

Unity means union or togetherness. Strength is basically the direct result of Unity. A group of people which stays united always achieves more success than a single person. That’s why groups are created in almost every field such as office, military forces, sports, etc. In our personal lives too, we live together in the family which give us strength and power to bear our sufferings and celebrate our happiness. At office, teams are formed to achieve any desired result. Likewise in sports and military, groups are created and strategies are made to achieve something. </p>

There is a famous story which is the base of the proverb ‘united we stand, divided we fall’. There was an old man who lived in a village with his three sons. The sons always fought with each other and would not pay any heed to their father. The man fell sick and assumed that he would die soon; he was very worried about the fact that once he dies, people would take advantage of his sons’ altercations. He called all his sons and asked them to break a bundle of stick, one by one. None of them could do it. He then untied the bundle and gave each stick to each one of them asking to break, which they could very conveniently accomplish. He then told his sons that they should stay like the bundle of the stick so that no one can break them; but if they keep on fighting and separated, they will be broken by the outsiders easily.

Unity is important in every phase of our lives. An individual can certainly survive alone, but for being happy and celebrating happiness or to bear the sufferings of life, one needs a companion and a family. Likewise, even a corporate cannot be successful, if it doesn’t have the team working with unity to achieve the common goal of the company. A nation also becomes economically strong if the countrymen support the government.<br>
No matter, how successful we become, we will always need people who can stand by us and support us. The proverb ‘United we stand, divided we fall’ will continue to teach lesson to people for years to come. Unity is the pillar of success and it also makes people considerate and understanding. It’s very easy to fight and stay apart from each other, but unity always has an upper hand over everything else. <p>
