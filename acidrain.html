    <p> Acid Rain refers to a highly acidic rainfall, which causes material atmospheric and environmental depletion. It majorly affects the plants, aquatic creatures, infrastructure etc. Being acidic means it contains elevated level of hydrogen ions, i.e., low pH. In fact, normal rain water is already slightly acidic with a pH range of 5.3-6.0, because carbon dioxide and water present in the air react together to form carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. When the pH level of rain water falls below this range, it becomes Acid Rain. </p><p>
Both natural and man-made sources are known to play a role in the formation of acid rain. But, it is mainly caused by combustion of fossil fuels which results in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).<br>

Acid Rain includes rain, snow, hail, fog, or dew that is high in acid pollutants, especially sulphuric and nitric acid. Acid Rain is caused by emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which reacts with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. </p><p>
The term “Acid Rain” was coined in 1872 by Robert Angus Smith. The problem of Acid Rain has not only increased with rapid growth in population and industrialisation, but has also become more alarming. In fact, the use of the smokestacks (tall chimneys on a factory, ship, etc) to reduce local pollution has contributed to the spread of Acid Rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.<br>
Large amount of acid deposits are witnessed in the Canada, United States and most of the parts of Europe, including portions of Sweden, Norway, and Germany, currently. In addition, some amount of acid deposits are found in parts of South Asia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Southern parts of India like Bangalore, New Delhi, Mumbai. </p><p>
Types of acid rain:<br>
There are two types of depositions in which acid rain occurs. They can be discussed as follows:<br>
Wet deposition: When the acid falls on the ground in the form of rain, snow, fog or mist, it removes acid from the atmosphere and settles them on the Earth’s surface. When this acid flows through the ground, it affects a large number of plants, animals and aquatic life. The water from drain flows into the water sources like rivers and canals which is then mixed up into sea water; thereby affecting the aquatic habitats. </p><p>
Dry deposition: When the acidic pollutants merge into dust or smoke and fall to the ground as dry particles, these stick to the ground and other surfaces such as buildings, cars, houses, trees and monuments. Majority of the acidic pollutants in the atmosphere spread through dry deposition. </p><p>
Causes of acid rain:<br>
The major causes of acid rain are Natural and Human-Instigated causes. However, Acid Rain is basically caused due to the combustion of fossil fuels which results in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) in the atmosphere.<br></p><p>
Natural Sources: The main nature causing agents for acid rain are volcanic eruptions. Volcanoes emit a large amount of lava, producing harmful gases which create higher than normal amount of Acid Rain. Decaying vegetation, wildfires and other biological processes within the environment also generate the Acid Rain forming gases. Dimethyl sulphide is a typical example of a major biological contributor to sulphur containing elements into the atmosphere. Lighting strikes also produce nitric oxides that react with water molecules via electrical activity to produce nitric acid, thereby forming acid rain. </p><p>
Human-Instigated Sources: Human activities leading to the emissions of chemical gas include sulphur and nitrogen gases from the factories, power generating premises and automobiles. Most of all, the use of coal for electrical power generation is the biggest contributor to gaseous emissions which lead to acid rain. These gases react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form various acidic compounds such as sulphuric acid, nitric acid etc. As a result, those areas experience exceedingly high amounts of acid rain. </p><p>
Harmful effects of acid rain:<br>
Acid Rain adversely affects the following broad categories of environment:<br>
•	Marine Biodiversity<br>
•	Soil<br>
•	Architecture & Infrastructure<br>
•	Forests and Forest wildlife<br>
•	Public Health and so on<br>
</p><p>
Methods to Avoid Acid Rain: Acid Rain caused due to the natural reasons cannot be stopped but there are ways following which we can avoid the same caused due to man-made reasons.
The ways by which acid rain can be avoided are as follows:<br>
By the use of limestone, known as liming process, by which people can repair the damages caused by Acid Rain to lakes, rivers, brooks and other water sources. By adding lime into acidic surface, water balances the acidity. Although, it only offers only a short-term solution at the expense of solving the broader challenges of SO2 and NOx emissions and risks to human health, nevertheless, it helps to restore and allow the survival of the marine life by improving chronically acidified waters. </p><p>
Millions of people directly or indirectly contribute towards SO2 and NOx emissions. Mitigation of this challenge requires individuals to be more updated about energy conservation such as; turning off lights or electrical appliances when not using them; use public transportation; use of energy efficient electrical appliances; and use of hybrid vehicles or those with negligible NOx emissions.<br>
Besides fossil fuels, there is a wide range of substitutable energy sources that can generate electrical power. These include wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, nuclear power and hydro energy. Harnessing these energy sources can offer effective electrical power alternatives instead of using fossil fuels. Natural gas, fuel cells and batteries can also substitute use of fossil fuels.<br>

As you can see, there are many attempts to clean our air, but due to increase in population and rapid industrialisation, we need to make efforts on a war footing to reduce the phenomenon of Acid Rain. The whole world needs to take a call to avoid inflicting colossal damage to the environment.
