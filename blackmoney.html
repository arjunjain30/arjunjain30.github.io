    <p>The money that is earned and hoarded by dishonest and unfair means and kept in secret to evade taxes is called black-money. It becomes black because no taxes are paid on it. No taxes are paid on it because it is earned by dishonest and unfair means. Money turned to be black if taxes due thereon are evaded. The massive amount of black money in our country has created a parallel economy. <p>
<q>BLACK MONEY’ can be defined as ASSETS OR RESOURCES THAT HAVE NEITHER BEEN REPORTED TO THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AT THE TIME OF THEIR GENERATION NOR DISCLOSED AT ANY POINT OF TIME DURING THEIR POSSESSION.</q>
<p>

Black Money is one of the major problems being face by our country these days. This is one of the reasons behind the economic disparity that in turn causes social inequality which is the root cause of several problems in the country. There are a number of factors that lead to this problem. Some of these include the high rate of tax, increased cost of living, inflation, different rates of excise duty and the real estate market.

One of the sources of black money generation in developing countries like India is through commission or kick backs obtained for arranging government deals and purchase. Foreign multinationals and cartels make heavy pay off to supply their weapons, technology and knowhow. Agents and middlemen pocket considerable sums as their share of commission in the payoff to influence political decisions. Favoritism and patronage by those in authority also lead to generation of black money. Other factors for generation of black money include (i) high rates of taxation under direct taxes which encourages tax evasion, (ii) controls, permits and licenses (iii) price control without adequate machinery for effective distribution (iv) pugree and hawale systems, (v) donations to political parties for elections (vi) corrupt business practices, (vii) smuggling and other illegal anti-social activities. </p>
<p>
The National Institute of Public Policy has roughly estimated the amount of black money in our economy at around Rs 37,000 Crores. This is a little over one-fifth of the gross domestic product (GDP). The institute pointed out that for its very nature, the unaccounted income could not be precisely quantified. According to published reports, and International Monetary Fund survey of the unaccounted sector of the economy in various countries has estimated black money in India at 50 percent of its gross product (GNP). </p>
<p>

<b>But the most important negative effect of black money on an economy is in its opportunity cost. </b>For a growing economy like India, time is of essence. We cannot afford to be complacent at such a crucial stage of our development. All black money represents the hundreds of beneficial projects we could have executed had we had that money. We could have build infrastructure, provided better health services, developed SME's etc if the money that is rightfully the governments' had not been diverted away. 

We cannot quantify as of now if the Indian economy had been different if there was no black money as it is impossible to observe the counterfactual, it is still plausible to guess that we would have been better off. </p>
<p>

Some measure may be suggested for curbing the generation and spread of parallel economy of black money.<br>
•	Leaders and persons in position should file a return of their assets and incomes which should be subjected to scrutiny by a special agency created for this purpose.<br>
•	Lowering of tax rates so that tax evasion becomes unnecessary. Tendency to evade tax creeps in when tax rates are high. <br>
•	Controls, licenses, and permits should be reduced to minimum. If necessary, they should be made available without under the table payments. <br>
•	As recommended by Wanchoo committee, agriculture income should also be subjected to income tax as other incomes. <br>
•	Government should subsidies election expenditure of political parties as is done in West Germany. <br>
•	Heavy capital gains tax should be lowered. <br>
•	Registration fees in relation to property and other real estate should be lowered. <br>
•	All tax laws should be revised so as to eliminate loopholes. <br>
•	Deterrent punishment must be given to those who are found guilty of profiteering, black-marketing and smuggling. <br>

While the Modi government has taken the step of demonitization to break this illegal wealth accumulation, there is still a lot that needs to be done in order to bring this problem down. People must understand the importance of paying the tax and should refrain from concentrating black money. The small contribution each citizen does in the form of taxes helps in the development of the country. </p>
