he idiom “Child is the Father of Man” implies that the actual nature of a man does not alter with age or time. However, it has been interpreted in various other ways as well. “Child is the Father of Man” basically means that a man is, in reality, the product of the behaviour and habits he developed during his early years. Many other interpretations have also been made from this idiom. <br>

The famous proverb ‘The Child is father of the Man’ is written by William Wordsworth through his famous poem ‘My Heart leaps up’. The poet through this line tries to say that the basic nature of a man gets developed in his/her childhood itself. When he was a child, he used to enjoy nature and even when he has grown up as an adult, he enjoys the nature. Because enjoying the nature or rainbow is his basic character which got developed when he was a small child. </p>
<p>


The proverb became highly popular due to the deep meaning hidden inside the line. It means that the core personality of a person gets developed since one’s childhood and it majorly depends upon the upbringing one gets at home and the teachings one gets at the school. Thus, based on the kind of upbringing and teaching, the individual develops positive or negative personality traits at the later stage of one’s life. Also, by looking at the child’s behaviour, one can identify what kind of person one is going to be. </p>
<p>

Even from the learning perspective, whatever learning, education and knowledge one gains in the childhood remains with the person forever. A child is considered to be the source of learning for the adult. A child is innocent and full of life, but when he grows up as a man, he tends to lose the charm and innocence due to various responsibilities and hardships. But the poet did not lose the childhood charm; he enjoyed the rainbow even as a grown up man. Likewise, each individual must enjoy life without boundaries and pressures like a child does. </p>
<p>

Like morning is the base of the day; childhood is the base of the overall personality and character of a man. Childhood activities influence the activities and performance of a man. If a child gets healthy environment and grows up amongst the motivational and cheerful people; he is certainly going to become a happy and confident person and if a child is brought up in a chaotic atmosphere; he will grow up to be a rebel. That’s why it’s been said that the child is the father of man. It’s the responsibility of the parents and teachers to control their actions and words and inspire the children to learn good habits right from the beginning; because children are fast learners and their knowledge remains with them for their lifetime. A person is not only responsible for his own conduct but his conducts and behaviour reflect the society too; hence it is important that the child is taught good moral values and to perform good deeds so that the child can make the world a better place to live in, when he grows up. </p>
<p>

Conclusion
Some people, despite having healthy upbringing and delightful memories during childhood tend to become a serious and quiet person; there is no harm in enjoying the nature and every little things like rainbow, butterfly, birds, etc; because they not only please you without costing anything, but they also maintain your innocence and childhood. A man must always remember that his personality must portray his childhood.
