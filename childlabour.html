What is Child Labour Law ?<br>
Child Labour is the practice of having children engage in economic activity , on part or full-time basis. The practice deprives children of their childhood , and is harmful to their physical and mental development . Poverty , lack of good schools and the growth of the informal economy are the key causes of child labor in India.<br>
How law system is tackling Child Labour ? India law specifically defines 64 industries as hazardous and its a criminal offence to employ children in such factories. Notably Constitution of India also prohibits child labour in industries as a Fundamental Right under Article 24. UNICEF has observed that India with such huge population have highest number of workers under 14 years of age. International Labour Organisation estimates that agriculture , at 60 percent is the largest employer of child labour in the world. While United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 70% of child labour is deployed in agriculture and related activities. Major child labour is observed in all informal sector of the Indian economy. </p><p>

Recent studies estimate that 168 million children aged 5 to 17 (with around 120 million of them below age 14) are involved in child labor. Millions of other children are forced into slavery, child soldiering, drug trafficking, or sexual exploitation. While these rates are slowly declining, child labor remains a threat to economies around the world. The children that are employed at a young age are frequently familiar with violence and deprived of education.
Recently, a human rights organization alleged that Apple, Samsung, and Sony failed to conduct regular inspections to ensure that materials they use are not associated with child labor. Because of this, the organization is claiming that children as young as seven are working in dangerous conditions to mine cobalt, an important component of lithium-ion batteries used in tech products. Some of the hazards associated with mining cobalt are risks of long-term health problems, unsanitary conditions, and fatal accidents. In response to the recent allegations, Apple issued a statement that said: “Underage labour is never tolerated in our supply chain and we are proud to have led the industry in pioneering new safeguards." While all the companies are investigation the claims, all of them have issued statements talking about their zero tolerance policies. </p><p>
Poverty, not choice, leads to child labour”<br>
Childhood is considered to be one of the most care-free and joyous of one’s stages of life. But sadly it is not true for every kid in India.<br>
1.Poverty and lack of Education are the main reasons for child labour. Working in cheap restaurants, brick kiln and bangle and matchbox factories and as domestic labourers, these children of a lesser god, learn the lessons of life the ‘harsh’ way and do not have an easy childhood.<br>
2.They are considered adult-enough to work by their under-nourished and poverty-stricken families once these children cross the age of eight or so. Child labour may be unlawful but for poor families it sometimes becomes a necessary evil to keep their homes running.<br></p><p>

As a human being we need to do something for them because they are the ones who hold the future of INDIA .
Now firstly what we have to do is find these children around us who are not strong enough to go in the school means their family condition is not that much good or children who are doing labour near out your home .
After this we have to convince them for study or for go in the school ,
Now the next step we have to give them at least 4 hours for their study and some money for their study According to your salary if you are a student then give them some time its enough .
Now Suppose if anyone of the child will get success in future then what will we your condition- “You are like a GOD for that boy/girl” </p><p>
The Factories Act of 1948 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory. The Mines Act of 1952 prohibits the employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine. Also, various laws and the Indian Penal Code, such as the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act-2000, and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Abolition) Act-1986 seek to prevent the practice of child labour in India. Unfortunately, these laws and regulations have not been backed by effective and proper implementation and enforcement.<br>
Collective efforts are needed on the part of society and the government to put an end to the practice of child labour. In fact, every citizen should take a pledge to never employ child labourer, rather discourage others too from doing so. We should create awareness amongst people employing child labourers and the parents sending their children to work. We need to provide our children a happy childhood where they are able to enjoy the best period of their lives with a merry and carefree attitude. The government should make efforts to increase the incomes of parents by launching various development schemes. Efforts should be made towards poverty eradication combined with educational reforms to provide free or affordable access to quality education. Only by taking comprehensive steps, the Government can hope to eliminate all forms of child labour by 2020.
