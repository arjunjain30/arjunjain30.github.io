    <p>Terrorism in a very general sense is defined as the use of violence so as to instigate fear and apprehensions so as to achieve some political goal(generally).<br>
Terrorism is a concept which is surrounded by a high degree of subjectivity and is subject to different interpretations by different people(scholars) which has made this concept much debatable as “one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter”. As a result of which, this issue becomes more intricate and puts the world in jeopardy. </p><p>
Terrorism implies the use of violence to terrorise a population or government for certain political, religious or ideological purpose. The threat of terrorism has become a worldwide concern with several parts of the world reeling under frequent terrorist strikes. With little concern for human lives, terrorists continue to strike with impunity, leaving a trail of death and destruction, wherever they choose to inflict their blows.<br></p><p>
There have been several terror attacks in India, resulting in grievous loss of lives and properties.
The history of terrorism is as old as humans presence on earth. Terrorism is nothing but installing a sense of fear among people. Who knows for how many long years humans might have been terrorized by humans. But some noted terrorist activities were done by sicarri (First century terrorist). There name literally means assassins or murderers or the dagger men. Sicarri terrorism was nothing but a Jewish resistance to roman rule, which began in 40 BC. They used short daggers to murder people in public,. Although they were not terrorist in the modern sense , but there method of killing people in crowded places did terrorize the surrounding on lookers. </p><p>
The term terrorism comes from the reign of terror in French revolution. This reign of terror was initiated by Maxmilien robespeiere in 1793. Maxmilien believed in his so called ideology that, terrorism is necessary to install a stability and better system in the country . <br> 
Many terrorist organization having a nationalist agenda have spread throughout the world. Similar to Irish republican brotherhood, which wanted to separate from great Britain, Kurdistan workers party formed in 1970’s . Has an objective to form a separate Kurdish state. Kurds are distinct ethnic group living in turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. They used terrorist tactics to form a separate kurdish state. Similarly the srilankan liberation tigers of Tamil eelam used terrorist activities like bombing, murdering. They were ethnic Tamil minorities in Srilanka, whose objective was to defeat the Sinhalese majority government.<br></p><p>
Now in this 21st century we are facing the threat of religious terrorism. Terrorist have taken the frame of religion to complete their goals by installing fear among people. Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Boko Haram, ISIS, are the terrorist organization which justify their act considering Islamic religion. Al-Qaeda was founded by Osama Bin Laden in 1988; they were the Muslim fighters who fought the soviets, following their invasion of Afghanistan. Now their objective is to eradicate American military and culture from the Middle East and to form a strict Islamic rule. Hamas is a group that was founded in 1987 whose aim is to establish an Islamic state in the GAZA strip by opposing the Israel government. Similar to Islamic terrorism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism has also witnessed their militant organization. </p><p>

You won’t believe but there are 100 to 170 officially designated terrorist organization throughout the world.
Al-Shahaab, Muslim Brotherhood, Irish National Liberation Army, Hezbollah, Palestinian, Islamic Jihad, Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Balochistan liberation army, Al-Nausra, Uyghur, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Khalistan zindabad force, Indian Mujahideeen…. And the list goes on.<br>
But the organization which is making the news recently is ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria).
They are in the news recently because they are winning. Their objective is to establish a Sunni Islamic State in Iraq and Levant region which includes Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus, and Southern Turkey, Strictly according to the Sharia Laws. </p><p>
Terrorist and insurgent groups in India receive funding from various sources such as Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI); religious, fundamentalist and pan-Islamic jihadi organisations in Pakistan; ostensibly charitable organisations in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; the mafia group led by Dawood Ibrahim who operates from Karachi, Pakistan.
Sometimes, terrorists resort to extortions and ransom payments for releasing hostages, and collect contributions — voluntary or forced — from the people living in the area where they operate. Narcotics smuggling is another source of funding for terrorist organizations and they use informal hawala channel to transmit funds.<br></p><p>

<p>
Terrorism presents a grave challenge to the people and government of India. If we want to effectively deal with this menace, the entire nation needs to stand united to fight the perpetrators of terror. All political parties need to rise above their partisan lines to give a befitting reply to terrorists and their masterminds operating from across the borders. India has to demonstrate that it is not a soft state but a capable nation with zero tolerance to any terrorist activities carried out by the enemies of the nation.
