Time is valuable more than money in life because without understanding the value of time and proper utilization of time in right direction, we cannot earn money. Money and time, both are very different things because we can store money and use it accordingly however we cannot save, store or use time accordingly. It passes every moment and never stops for anyone. It brings opportunities to everyone however benefits those who work on the time. <br>
        </p><p>
Time is very precious for us. It brings opportunities to us however not always. It is the thing which never stays for anyone and moves continuously on its track. It comes only once in someone’s life and never stays even for a second. It is favorable for those who understand its value and use it properly however unfavorable for the idle people who waste it or use it improperly. Once it gone never returns just like tide which occur in the sea. This popular proverb ‘time and tide wait for none’ itself proves its truth in all the spheres of life. </p>
<p>

A person, who has missed his/her train and has to postpone all the schedule of that day, may better understand the value of time. He/she might not miss the train in future ever as he/she has learned that how much he/she has lost due to the little mistake. Time matters a lot for them who are involved in hard work in anyway and wanted to achieve their goal. It does not give chance to anyone to correct the mistakes of past however one can correct the present and thus future too by avoiding the mistakes and valuing the time. </p>
<p>

Scientists who make inventions and discover new technologies, students who have missed the chance of sitting in the final exams and person who has missed the flight, etc understand the importance of time very well. Time changes people’s luck into good luck or bad luck accordingly he/she uses the time. People who are idle always curse their fate for not getting the things they wish. Whereas, hard working people do their works on time and believe on their own hard work. In order to get success in any field and achieve goals what we have decided, we should never waste time and must perform all the work at appropriate time. </p>
<p>

We should involve ourselves in the hard work with the patience to wait for the proper and favorable time. Success will come surely when we have made the best use of time. Time values a lot differently to the people working in different areas such as farmers have to sow crop seeds timely in proper season otherwise they will miss the chance for whole season. Sports persons get fixed time to defeat the competitor and win the game by scoring more goals against the opponent team. Thus, time is very precious in every area for every work. We should use it and never waste!
