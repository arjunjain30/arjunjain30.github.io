    <q><b> To a Thirsty man, a drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold.”<br>
“Thousands Lived without Love, but not without water. ...<br>
        “Water Covers 2/3 of the surface of the Earth but Only 0.002% is Drinkable. ...<br></b>
</q>
<p>

70% of the earth is water. The human body contains 75% of water. An average human body has around 42.5 liters of water in his body and a mere deficiency of 2.4 liters cam leads to dehydration. Humans can survive up to 3 weeks without food but not more than 3 days without water. We need to note that there is no substitute for water yet. Now it is very clear how important is water for the existence of life on earth.<br>
The question here is that if we have 66% of earth covered with water why do we still face water scarcity. It is because of limited 3% availability of fresh water. Rest of it is sea water which is salty and unfit.<br>
In the last 50 years, the extraction of fresh water from glaciers has increased by 3 folds. Due to advancement in lifestyle more of water is in demand. Which also means an increase in the demand for power supply thus water.
</p>
<p>


Even in the environment, we live in, needs water for a sustainable life cycle. Saving water helps in maintaining the balance of life on earth which would come to danger in case of water scarcity. So wastage of water will not only influence us but every species on earth will be endangered. According to the reports of Bureau of Reclamation, almost 21 water species have become extinct in the last 100 years in USA alone due to the disturbance in the environmental balance basically because of population expansion and therefore increase in water demand. <br></p>
        <p>

We need to first realize that conservation of water is the responsibility of every individual. It is to be done in a collective manner. No government official or organization can help us in saving water unless we ourselves want to. This time right now is the high time. We all need to join hands to save every possible drop of water. </p>

How to save water in home?</b><br>
•	Avoid showers, use a bucket instead to take bath and reduce your bathing time as much as you can, try to limit it to 5 minutes, you can save over 1000 gallons of water every year. <br>
•	Do not brush or wash hair with running tap water use it wisely. This will save 1500 gallons per month for a family of 4. <br>
•	Check for toilet leaks every six months and replace the toilet flapper every 4 moths to prevent water wastage. <br>
•	Usage of energy optimized washing machine reduces the use of water. <br>
•	Black and dark clothes are supposed to be washed in cold water, this method helps saving water and also retaining the color of cloth. <br>
•	The waste water from washing clothes needs to be utilized to water plants in the backyard. <br>
•	In the kitchen, do not wash utensils with running water instead use two separate water for wash and rinse. <br>
•	Energy efficient dishwashers should be used instead of washing them by hand because dishwashers consume less water comparatively<br>
Rainwater harvesting is basically a method to store rainwater and bring it to suitable use in the later time period. The system has different units which include transportation of rain water, filtration and storing of the processed water. <br>
•	We should all install a rainwater storing unit in our houses to save more water. <br></p>
<p>

Drip Irrigation: In this method of irrigation, water is provided to the plant roots drop by drop, reducing waste of water by evaporation. A proper drip Irrigation arrangement can save up to 80% of water in comparison to the traditional method of irrigation.<br>
Organic Farming: Organic farming not only helps to maintain soil water level but also recharges ground level water by 20%. Organic farming has a 30% more yielding capacity during droughts. Since it does not require harmful pesticides it also helps to improve producing the capacity of the soil.<br></p><p>
We should teach children to turn off faucets tightly after use, adjust sprinklers to water your lawn. Plant in the fall when conditions are cooler and collect water used for rinsing fruits and vegetables to water house plants, wash your pets outdoors in an area of your lawn that needs water and repair leaking pipes, harvest rain water. People use up our planets fresh water faster than it can naturally be replenished so, save water for the Earth, family and community. Cultural views of water are based on predominent religious views, like the Ganges river in Hinduism. Water is known as the elixir of life. So Conserve water to save life. </p>
<p>
Water saving techniques should be promoted among people living in the societies, communities, villages including business sections as they are the main water users in rough manner. Farmers, children, and women should be taught properly about how to use and save water in efficient manner. They must understand the value of water in their life. Clean water scarcity is not a problem of one country or continent; it is a global issue which needs to be solved globally by increasing awareness about it among people worldwide.
